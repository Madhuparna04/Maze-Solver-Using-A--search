This Project Contains Code for Unity Game - Maze Solver.

Maze Solver uses A* search Algorithm to solve a maze that can be customized.

Instructions -

1. To change the number of rows, columns and add, delete or modify position of obstacles change attributes of Maze Creator Object.

2. To change Starting and Ending position of the player modify the start and goal attributes of Player object.

About A* Algorithm:

It is one of best algorithm used in path finding and graph traversals. It finds the approximate distance with the help of heuristics. The different types of heuristics used are Manhattan Distance Heuristic, Diagonal Distance Heuristic, etc. This project uses the Manhattan Distance Heuristic.
